This is a simple C++ class containing methods to easily create C++ vectors, as well as simple operations to add 
and compare vectors of integers. The purpose of this is to easily manipulate integers that would be to large to store 
as 32 bit longs.

Usage: This code does not contain an interface, so you must replace the code in main.cc with code that creates your vectors, as
well as the operations you which to perform.
NOte: main.cc contains some basic test cases for the vector operations
